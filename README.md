# Siamese-Network
A siamese neural network (SNN) is a class of neural network architectures that contain two or more identical sub-networks. “Identical” here means they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights. In this project we will use a Siamese Network to identify if the two input images are of the same person or not.
